        <h1>Tabla - Traditional musical instrument</h1>

        <h2>Origins and History:</h2>
        <p>
            The exact origins of the tabla are subject to debate, with theories pointing to both indigenous Indian roots and influences from the Middle East.
            Evidence suggests evolution from earlier Indian drums like the pakhawaj and possible influences from drums brought by Muslim invaders.
            The modern tabla is believed to have developed significantly in the 18th century.
            The development of distinct "gharanas" (schools) of tabla playing further shaped its evolution.
        </p>

        <h2>Instrument Features:</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Two Drums:</b><br>

            Dayan (right-hand drum):<br>
        
                Typically made of wood, it produces higher-pitched tones.
                Bayan (left-hand drum): Traditionally made of clay, but now often of metal (brass, copper, or steel), it produces lower, bass tones.
            <br>Syahi:<br>
                A unique feature is the "syahi," a black paste made of iron filings and other ingredients applied to the drumheads.
                The syahi is crucial for producing the tabla's distinctive tonal qualities and complex sounds.
            <br>Construction:<br>
                The drumheads are made of layered animal skin, held in place by leather straps.
                Tuning is achieved by adjusting the tension of these straps.
        </p>

        <h2>Musical Role:</h2>
        <p>
            The tabla is the primary percussion instrument in Hindustani (North Indian) classical music.

            It provides rhythmic accompaniment to vocal and instrumental performances.
        
        Versatility:<br>
            Tabla players are known for their improvisational skills, creating intricate rhythmic patterns and solos.
            The tabla repertoire includes a vast range of compositions, from simple to highly complex.    
        </p>

        <h2>Gharanas (Schools)</h2>
       <p>Gharanas are stylistic schools of tabla playing, each with its own unique techniques, compositions, and traditions.

        <ul>
            <li>Delhi Gharana</li>
